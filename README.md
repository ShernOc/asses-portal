# Assessment Portal

# Overview
The Knowledge Assessment Portal is designed to evaluate students' understanding of various programming languages before they enroll in courses. The primary goal is establishing a baseline of each student's knowledge, allowing instructors to tailor course materials to the existing student's skill level. 

# Problem Statement
Understanding students' learning pathways in programming courses can be challenging. Without a clear baseline of their knowledge, it's difficult to tailor the course content effectively. This portal addresses this problem by assessing students' proficiency in programming languages before they enroll.

# Objectives
Assess Programming Knowledge: Evaluate users' understanding of various programming languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python) through assessments.
Future Collaboration: Provide Feedback: Offer feedback on quiz performance to help students gauge their strengths and areas for improvement.
Enrollment Recommendations: Recommend appropriate course levels (Phase 0, 1, or 2) based on the assessment results to ensure students are placed in the right course level

# Features
