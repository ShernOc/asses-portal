            <p>
            The Assessment Portal is designed to evaluate students' understanding of various programming languages before they enroll in courses. The primary goal is establishing a baseline of each student's knowledge, allowing instructors to tailor course materials to the existing student's skill level. 
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

            Understanding students' learning pathways in programming courses can be challenging. Without a clear baseline of their knowledge, it's difficult to tailor the course content effectively. This portal addresses this problem by assessing students' proficiency in programming languages before they enroll.
